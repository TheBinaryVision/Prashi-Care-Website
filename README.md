**Prashi Care** is a modern, high-performance healthcare platform designed to bridge the gap between hospital ICUs and home comfort. This Single Page Application (SPA) serves as the digital front door for a critical care startup, enabling patients to book ICU setups, ventilator support, and skilled nursing services instantly.

This project was architected with a focus on **User Experience (UX)**, **Speed**, and **Trust**, utilizing a mobile-first approach and modern glassmorphism aesthetics.

* **🎨 Scroll Animations:** Integrated **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for dynamic entry effects.
* **📨 Serverless Contact Form:** Fully functional "Request Call Back" system powered by Netlify Forms (No backend required).
* **💬 Instant Support:** Floating WhatsApp integration for direct patient-to-provider communication.
* **🔍 SEO Optimized:** Pre-configured Open Graph tags and Meta descriptions for high visibility on Google and Social Media.
